## About the Project

For our final project in the Cyber4s course, we chose to unite our two passions: sports and our newfound interest, coding. Once we determined that our project would focus on fitness, we discussed our training routines and the apps/websites we use. During conversations with fitness trainers, we learned that they manage all their activities through WhatsApp and Excel files.
We used the new technologies we learned to design a website that greatly facilitates communication between trainees and coaches.

- <u>**Server side Environment**</u>- Node.js
